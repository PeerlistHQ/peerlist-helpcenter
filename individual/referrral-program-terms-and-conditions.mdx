The Peerlist Invite Friends and Earn Rewards program allows users to earn store credit by inviting new members to join Peerlist. Rewards are issued in U.S. dollars and can be redeemed as coupon credits on the <a href={PEERLIST_STORE} target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Peerlist Store</a>.

## How It Works

* You will receive **$1** for every valid user who joins Peerlist using your unique invite link and completes their profile (min 40%).

* You will receive an **additional $1** when the invited user **completes their** <a href={APP_PATHS.verification}>**profile verification**</a>.

* Earnings are recorded in the "Rewards History" section and can be redeemed as store coupons.

<Warning>
  Any attempt to exploit or manipulate the program — including but not limited to creating fake accounts, using bots, or other dishonest methods is strictly prohibited.

  If any suspicious activity is detected, **Peerlist reserves the right to suspend or permanently ban both the inviting and invited accounts**.

  Peerlist may withhold earned rewards and take action where applicable.
