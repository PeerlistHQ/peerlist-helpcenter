  <Accordion title="What are Staff-Picked projects? How are they decided?">
    Staff-Picked projects on Peerlist are handpicked by our team and featured prominently on the Scroll as the *"Staff Pick of the Day."* The goal is to spotlight projects that truly stand out in the community. While there's no strict or formal criteria, selections are generally based on a mix of factors such as **originality**, **usefulness**, the **overall experience**, and **relevance to the Peerlist audience**. We also take into account creativity, problem-solving, polish, and presentation. Ultimately, staff picks celebrate thoughtful, impactful, and inspiring work that resonates with the broader tech community on Peerlist.

    To ensure fairness and avoid bias, staff picks are finalized on Tuesday, the day after our weekly launch day. The team reviews all submissions objectively and selects six projects, one for each day from Tuesday to Sunday to be featured throughout the week.
