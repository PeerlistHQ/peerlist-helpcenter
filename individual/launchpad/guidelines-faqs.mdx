5. **Do not ask for upvotes**: Ask for support by adding feedback by commenting and sharing on other social platforms! The number of upvotes is a small variable of a bigger equation of the ranking system.

Always ensure that any information you submit is original and properly cited, and avoid copying content from other sources without permission.

## For the community

By following these guidelines, you can provide valuable feedback and help ensure that the Products Spotlight remains a fair and equitable platform for showcasing innovative and high-quality products.

1. **Be valuable**: Provide feedback that is relevant and valuable to the creators and other community members.

2. **Be constructive**: When providing feedback, be constructive and focus on how the product can be improved. Avoid making personal attacks or using abusive language, as this can harm the product creator's motivation and may deter them from participating in future events.

3. **Be specific**: Provide specific feedback on what you liked and didn't like about the product. Be specific about the features that you found interesting, and suggest improvements for areas that you believe could be enhanced.

4. **Be fair**: Be fair and impartial when upvoting products. Avoid upvoting products just because you know the product creator, and instead, focus on the quality and innovation of the product itself.

5. **Engage with the community**: Engage with the community by asking questions and offering your insights. This can help create a dialogue around the product and encourage more people to get involved.

6. **Respect the rules**: Finally, make sure to respect the rules and guidelines of the product of the month program. This includes refraining from engaging in any activities that may be harmful or disruptive to the community and treating all participants with respect and professionalism.
