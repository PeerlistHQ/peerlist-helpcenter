Peerlist Scroll is a context feed where peers share everything about what they are working on, reading, writing, their learnings, questions, queries, feedback, and everything in between. It's a content feed with pre-defined post context added to every post.

## What is post context?

Post contexts are nothing but specific topics under which you can share your post on Peerlist. It's mandatory to have a context so that users can sort their Scroll feed based on context. It also helps to promote/share high-quality content.

If you're new to Peerlist, you must be wondering what should I post on Peerlist. Here's a quick guideline on what to share on Peerlist Scroll.

Here are different contexts:

### #show — Showcase your work, thoughts, and learnings.

Use this context to highlight what you're working on, your learnings, or an interesting article you've read. Whether it's a screenshot of your work-in-progress project, your progress so far, or a request for early feedback, this is the place for it.

Here are some examples of what you can share under this context:

* The project you're working on

* An article you wrote or found interesting

* Your progress in learning a new tool or programming language

* Your wins and achievements (humble bragging!)

In general, share your work, thoughts, learnings, and stories. Make sure your post is engaging and not cringe-worthy.

If you're still unsure, just ask yourself, "What am I working on?" — the answer is your post idea!

> Avoid sharing only link without a post caption. Posts with only link will automatically be hidden/removed from feed.

### #ask — Do you have a question?

Use this context when you want to ask something or gather insights from the community. Conduct polls, collect opinions, and seek answers. Ensure your question is engaging enough to encourage responses. Don't ask to ask, just ask!

> **Most important**: This is also where others ask for your help, so if you see a post seeking assistance, don't hesitate to offer your support!

***

### #book — What are you reading?

This is a favorite context for many Peerlist members, where you can share a book you are reading, finished reading, or want to read. We've seen many people network over common reading interests!

***

### #hiring — Are you hiring?

If you or your company is looking to hire, use this context. Be as detailed as possible when sharing the opportunity. We encourage only those directly associated with the company or those offering referrals to share opportunities under the #hiring context.

***

### #open\_for — Are you open to opportunities?

You can let the community know if you're open to new opportunities, mentoring, consulting, freelance work, etc. under this context.

***

### #event — Are you hosting or attending an event?

Quite self-explanatory. If you're hosting or attending any event, you can share that under this context. If you've attended any conference or meetup, share the picture and details.

## Featured Context

Peerlist will occasionally feature special contexts to highlight content related to specific events. For instance, during the WWDC 2024 announcement, we used #wwdc2024 as a featured context to curate and share related content. Similarly, for the Figma Config event, we will be using **#Config2024**.
