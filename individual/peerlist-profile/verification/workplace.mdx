You can verify your **current** workplace by providing your work email associated with the company/organization.


<Note>
Before you continue, please note;

 - You can verify only the current workplace.
 - You need to have work email associated with the company.
 - Student email id cannot be used to verify workplace except faculty.
 - Verification through documents such as offer letter, salary slips, or any other misc document cannot be used for workplace verification.

If your company has a profile on Peerlist, the admin can verify your association with it. This also allows your past workplaces to be verified.
