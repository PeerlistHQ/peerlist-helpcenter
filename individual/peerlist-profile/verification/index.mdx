At Peerlist, we believe authenticity is the foundation of meaningful interactions. A verification badge on your profile indicates that you've successfully verified key details about your account. Peerlist currently offers various forms of verification, each with specific eligibility and availability criteria.

Verified profile signals authenticity and credibility, encouraging others to connect with confidence. Verified members get access to exclusive features like Inbox, Articles, etc and also benefit from increased profile visibility and engagement.

When logged in to Peerlist, you’ll notice the verification badge displayed on a member’s profile picture or beside their name across the platform, making it easy to identify verified users at a glance.

<Note>
  You can verify the workplace you're currently working at or the educational institute you're currently attending. At the moment, verification for past workplaces or institutions isn't available.

### Verification details

* **Adding verifications is optional.** It’s not a mandatory step to create and complete your Peerlist profile.

* **Verification cost:** Workplace, educational institution, and bootcamp verification is free. Identity verification has a minimal fee associate with it.

* **Verifications are visible, but you can remove them anytime.** A verification indicating that your identity, workplace, educational institution or bootcamp is confirmed will be visible on your profile when you complete the verification process. The information used for verification (i.e. the work email address, student email address, or information on your ID card) will not be visible. You can remove verifications anytime from Manage Verification settings. Learn more about our practices in our <a href={APP_PATHS.privacyPolicy}>Privacy Policy</a>.

* **Verifications on your profile may change**. For example: The design of verification badge, location and the placement may change as the feature evolves.

* **in case of ID verification, if you change your name, you may have to re-verify** to keep your verification visible on your profile. When you verify your identity, the name you use must match the name on your Peerlist profile.
