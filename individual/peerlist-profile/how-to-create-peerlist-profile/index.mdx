**LinkedIn Profile URL**: You can share your LinkedIn profile URL to autofill some details like: first/last name, profile picture, work experience, education, certifications, projects, etc. This options makes the onboarding super fast and is recommended.

Please note that:

* We can autofill only if your LinkedIn profile is publicly available.

* You can use Autofill with LinkedIn only 3 times.

* This is a one-time import. That means it does not sync your LinkedIn profile and Peerlist profile and won’t automatically update the information in future.

* We try our best to get the most updated information from your Peerlist profile. But do cross-check the imported data is correct. If not; make the appropriate correction manually.

**Enter manually**: In case we couldn’t import your data from LinkedIn, please proceed with the Enter Manually option.
