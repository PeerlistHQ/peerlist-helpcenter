### What information Peerlist collects and Why

In order to give you the best possible experience using Peerlist, we collect information from your interactions with our network. We use common internet technologies, such as cookies and web server logs. We collect this basic information from everybody, whether they have an account or not.

We may share your account information with third parties in some circumstances, including:

1. with your consent;

2. to a service provider or partner who meets our data protection standards;

3. for survey or research purposes, after aggregation, anonymization, or pseudonymization;

### Data Storage

Peerlist uses third-party vendors and hosting partners for hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology we need to operate Peerlist. By using Peerlist Services, you authorize Peerlist to transfer, store, and use your information in United States, India and any other country where we operate. All service providers and third-party vendors are required to meet our data protection standards.

Both Peerlist Inc. and Stripe have access to the information that you submit through the verification flow. We rely on Stripe to help store your verification data. Stripe uses access controls and security standards that are at least as stringent as those used to handle their own KYC and payments compliance data.

Learn more about how Stripe <a href={STRIPE_COMMON_QUESTIONS} target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>handles and stores your data.</a>

### Site Monitoring

Peerlist uses a variety of third-party services to diagnose errors and improve the performance of our site. We aim to minimize the amount of personal information shared, but the information may include your IP address or other identifying information. All service providers and third-party vendors are required to meet our data protection standards.

### Payment Processing

Peerlist does not process payments directly — we rely on third-party services such as Stripe to receive payments and store any payment information. You are subject to [Stripe's Terms of Use](https://stripe.com/legal/consumer) and [Privacy](https://stripe.com/privacy) if you choose to make transaction via Stripe.

### Identity Verification

We use Stripe for identity document verification. Stripe collects identity document images, facial images, ID numbers and addresses as well as advanced fraud signals and information about the devices that connect to its services. Stripe shares this information with us and also uses this information to operate and improve the services it provides, including for fraud detection, authentication, and analytics. You may also choose to allow Stripe to use your data to improve Stripe's biometric verification technology. You can learn more about Stripe and read its privacy policy at [https://stripe.com/privacy](https://stripe.com/privacy).

Stripe asks for your consent before collecting and using your biometric information. It'll only use your verification data in accordance with the permissions you grant before starting the verification process, and based on its [Privacy Policy](https://stripe.com/privacy).

Learn more about how Stripe <a href={STRIPE_COMMON_QUESTIONS} target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>handles and stores your data</a>.

### Third-Party Embeds

Some of the content that you see displayed on Peerlist is not hosted by Peerlist. These "embeds" are hosted by a third party and embedded in Peerlist. For example YouTube videos, Codepens, Twitter tweets, Dribbble shots, Medium Posts or GitHub code (contribution graph, publicly visible repositories) that appear within a Peerlist profile, pages or posts. These files send data to the hosted site just as if you were visiting that site directly (for example, when you load a Peerlist profile with GitHub embedded in it, GitHub receives data about your activity). Peerlist does not control what data third parties collect in cases like this, or what they will do with it. Third-party embeds on Peerlist are not covered by this privacy policy; they are covered by the privacy policy of the third-party service. Be mindful when interacting with these services.

### Tracking & Cookies

We use browser cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you return to our Services. Third-party vendors may also use cookies for various reasons.

Peerlist uses a specific cookie in order to facilitate the use of Google Analytics and PostHog for users logged-in to the Applications or the Platforms ("Logged-In User). If you are a Logged-In User, Peerlist may use your Peerlist user ID in combination with Google Universal Analytics and Google Analytics to track and analyze the pages of the Services you visit. We do this only to better understand how you use the Website and the other Services, with a view to offering improvements for all Peerlist users; and to tailor our business and marketing activities accordingly, both generally and specifically to you. Google Analytics cookies do not provide Peerlist with any Personal Information. You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to this site by disabling cookies on your browser.

You may opt-out of this feature by installing the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on, by setting your web browser to refuse cookies, or by setting your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent. If you do so, note that some parts of the Site may not function properly.

We use Stripe Identity for identity verification and other business services. Stripe collects identifying information about you and the devices that connect to its services, which includes the use of cookies. Stripe uses this information to operate and improve the services it provides to us, including for fraud detection, authentication, and analytics. You can learn more about [Stripe](https://stripe.com/), [Stripe Identity](https://support.stripe.com/questions/common-questions-about-stripe-identity), and read its privacy policy at [https://stripe.com/privacy](https://stripe.com/privacy).

### Data Security

We use encryption (HTTPS/TLS) to protect data transmitted to and from our site. However, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure, so we can't guarantee security. You use the Service at your own risk, and you're responsible for taking reasonable measures to secure your account.

### Administrative Emails from Peerlist

Sometimes we'll send you emails about your account, service changes or new policies. You can't opt-out of this type of "transactional" email (unless you delete your account).

When you interact with a transactional email sent from Peerlist (such as opening an email or clicking on a particular link in an email), we may receive information about that interaction.

### Non-administrative Emails from Peerlist

Upon creating a Peerlist account, you will opt into the Peerlist marketing and product emails and another non-administrative email. Your email address and user profile information may be stored by a third-party email provider such as Sendgrid and/or Amazon SNS. You can opt-out of non-administrative emails such as digests, newsletters, and activity notifications through your account's "[Notification Settings](https://peerlist.io/user/settings/notifications)" page and at the link of the footer in any non-administrative email you receive from us.

When you interact with a non-administrative email sent from Peerlist (such as opening an email or clicking on a particular link in an email), we may receive information about that interaction.

### Deleting Your Personal Information

You can delete your account from <a href={PEERLIST_EXTERNAL_LINKS.account} target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Settings > Account</a> by yourself. You may request deletion of your personal information and account by emailing <a href={`mailto:${SUPPORT_EMAIL}`} target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>{SUPPORT_EMAIL}</a> Make sure the request sent for deletion is from a registered email id associated with the Peerlist account.

To protect information from accidental or malicious destruction, we may maintain residual copies for a brief time period. But, if you delete your account, your information and content will be unrecoverable after that time.

### Business Transfers

If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, reorganization or sale of assets such that your information would be transferred or become subject to a different privacy policy, we'll notify you in advance of any such change.

### Changes to this Policy

We reserve the right to revise this Privacy Policy at any time. If we change this Privacy Policy in the future, we will post the revised Privacy Policy and update the "Effective Date," above, to reflect the date of the changes.

### Governing Law

These terms are governed by the laws of United States without giving effect to any principles of conflict of laws. Any legal action or proceeding related to Other Party(s) access to, or use of, the Sites and/or Services or these Terms of Use shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts at Delaware, United States.

General Terms and Conditions are applicable to the Use of a Web Site.
